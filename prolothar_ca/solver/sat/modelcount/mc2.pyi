        Parameters
        ----------
        use_regular_graph_upper_bound : bool, optional
            if True (by default False), we use an upper bound if the constraint graph
            in the counting process is a regular graph.
            The number of satisyfing models is equivalent to the number of
            independent sets in the constraint graph
            (see the paper "Counting models for 2SAT and 3SAT formulae"
            by DahllÃ¶f et al.,
            https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0304397504007297).
            A regular graph is graph where all nodes have the same degree.
            The number of indepedent sets in a regular graph has an upper bound:

        use_regular_graph_lower_bound : bool, optional
            if True (by default False), we use a lower bound if the constraint graph
            in the counting process is a regular graph.

        ignore_non_solution_dpll_branch : bool, optional
            if True (by default False), we reduce exponential growth of the
            search space during DPLL split by only discovering the branch
            of a known existing solution. in this case, the variables of the
            CNF must be initialized to a solution before calling the count
            method
